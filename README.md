# TwoPoints

Task:

The application should draw lines between two points selected by the user. The lines must be continuous, but not necessarily straight. The lines may not cross any lines previously drawn. 

Examples:

-> User clicks at two points

-> A continuous line is drawn between the two points

-> User clicks at two new points

-> A new continuous line is drawn which does not cross the previous line(s)

-> And so on for any number of linesâ€¦

We will review the design, naming, comments, code structure, and algorithm. 

Please note that you may not copy and paste code from the Internet into your solution. You must write the code yourself. If you learn about specific parts of solving the problem from the Internet you must include the source (with an URL to the source and explain what you used as a comment in the code).
